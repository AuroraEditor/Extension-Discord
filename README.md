# Official Discord extension for AuroraEditor

WORK IN PROGRESS THIS MAY NOT WORK.

THE `0xWDG` workspace is used `AEExtensionKit`, it requires you to have a top level `AEExtensionKit` folder.
There is no need to use that workspace, but as long as i'm busy with `AEExtensionKit` the workspace fill stay inside this folder.

Thanks for using.
